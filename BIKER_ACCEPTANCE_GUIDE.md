## Testing Tips

### 1. Test with Multiple Bikers

Create multiple biker accounts and test first-come-first-served:
- Biker 1 accepts â†’ Order assigned to Biker 1
- Biker 2 tries to accept same order â†’ Gets error "already assigned"

### 2. Test Rejection Flow

- Biker 1 rejects â†’ Order broadcast again
- Biker 2 accepts â†’ Successfully assigned

### 3. Check Biker Availability

After acceptance:
```sql
SELECT is_available FROM bikers WHERE biker_id = 1;
-- Should return false
```

After delivery completion:
```sql
-- Biker should be available again
```
